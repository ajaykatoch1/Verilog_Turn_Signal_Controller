# Verilog_Turn_Signal_Controller
This project is for my digital logic course. We created a turn signal controller for a ford mustang's tail and forward lights. 
We used Verilog and Vivado to create this and implemented the functionality on an Xilinx FPGA. 

To use this, create a project in Vivado and import the files coresspoding by file types. The .xdc is a contraint and the .tb files are testbenches while the .v are source files.
Once imported run synthesis and implementation on Vivado and then run on the FPGA. The specified board is xc7a100tcsg. The buttons mapped can be found in the constraint file.
